# About

### What is this?

As by the name this API is based on the show [Rick and Morty](https://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty). By using this API will give you access multiple resources such as characters, objects, locations and quotes. 

By the time of writing this article the show is at Season 4, I will continue to add more resources as the Rick and Morty universe is so huge. 

### Why this API?

I made this API for any purpose but mostly educational. I got inspired by [Axel Fuhrmann](https://axelfuhrmann.com/), the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and I am a big fan of the show.

### Who am I?

I am [Erick Wachira](https://me.werick.codes), and I like building stuff with code.

### What is the stack of this API?

The API  was built with **NodeJS/Express** with **Mongo** as a database. I used the `express-rate-limit` library for limiting the number of requests per user.
